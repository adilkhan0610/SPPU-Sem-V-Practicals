Database Management Systems Laboratory
This folder contains codes & outputs for all Practicals that I've performed under Database Management Systems Laboratory.

I've also uploaded the respective databases that contain all the tables that I utilised.

Feel free to paste these in your /var/lib/mysql folder to use them for yourself.

Steps to Install MySQL on Ubuntu
Update your repositories using:

sudo apt-get update

To install the latest version of MySQL Server, run:

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Then

sudo apt-get install mysql-client

After the installation is done, run the following command to start the MySQL service:

sudo mysql

If you encounter any error in this step, try manually starting the MySQL service using:

sudo systemctl start mysql

To check the status of MySQL service, run:

sudo systemctl status mysql

To stop MySQL, run:

sudo systemctl stop mysql

To restart the MySQL service, run:

sudo systemctl restart mysql

Steps to Install MongoDB 7.0 on Ubuntu
Run the following commands one after the other:

sudo apt-get install gnupg curl

curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-7.0.asc | \sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg \--dearmor

If you get a warning to overwrite the configuration file, press Y

If you don't know already, use the following command to check your Ubuntu version:

lsb_release -a

For Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS)

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list

For Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS)

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list

Then, run:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

sudo systemctl start mongod

If you receive an error similar to the following when starting mongod:

Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.

Run the following command first:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl status mongod

You should see an active(running) status.

Type q to exit.

To start MongoDB server, type the following command:

mongosh
